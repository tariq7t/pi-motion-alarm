# pi-motion-alarm
I have created a burglar alarm system, which uses motion sensor and a camera to detect and alert when movement is detected. This program uses Raspberry pi camera module to detect movement. A PIN code is used to arm and disarm the alarm system. The program can be accessed through web browser, allowing it to be accessible on personal phone and tab as well.
